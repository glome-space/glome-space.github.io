# About the _Glome_

## Coming Soon!

## Open Source
The _Glome_ is committed to open source values. All contributed lessons make use of open source programming languages and software whenever possible. This policy is meant to minimize costs for all parties, and to allow the greatest possible level of participation. We believe everyone should be able to benefit from this software, not just those with large  budgets for expensive proprietary software.
